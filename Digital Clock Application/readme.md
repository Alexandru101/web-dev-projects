The Digital Clock Application displays the current time, weekday, month, and year. The project primarily demonstrates the use of JavaScript's Date() function to retrieve the current date and time, and then formating those values into readable strings for the user.

### Key Features
- Displays the current time (hours, minutes, seconds)
- Shows the current weekday (e.g., Monday, Tuesday)
- Presents the current month (e.g., January, February)
- Displays the current year
